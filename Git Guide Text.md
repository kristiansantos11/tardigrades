# Using Gitbash

Note: Always work on your own local branch.

- If the remote master branch is updated:
###### git pull origin master 

(Pulls the master branch from the remote repository and merges it on your current branch.)

- If you're going to update the remote master branch:
###### git push origin <name of branch>

(Pushes the current branch to the remote repository.)
Note: Make a pull request then merge it yourself to the main branch.
