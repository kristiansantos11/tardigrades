# Using Gitbash

Note: Always work on your own local branch.

### If the remote master branch is updated:
#### git pull origin master 
##### pull the master branch from the remote repository

### If you're going to update the remote master branch:
#### git push origin *name of branch* 
##### pushes the current branch to the remote repository
Note: It pushes your current branch. Then make a pull request then merge it yourself to the main branch.
